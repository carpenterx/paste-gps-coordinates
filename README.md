An application for plotting GPS coordinates to a map and generating a route that visits all of them by using the [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API.

## About

I created this application in response to this reddit thread: [Paste GPS coordinates & plot them in a Map?](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/tk9xak/paste_gps_coordinates_plot_them_in_a_map/)

### From reddit:

#### Paste GPS coordinates & plot them in a Map?

Is there any software which lets paste coordinates and it will automatically create a route with all these destinations ?

Here's an example of what I mean

38.3191, -92.5414

38.32385, -92.5452

38.3297, -92.54274

38.33261, -92.5272

38.31506, -92.52226
